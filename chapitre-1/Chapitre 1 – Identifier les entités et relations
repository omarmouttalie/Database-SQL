--Summary:
Objective: Learn how to analyze functional needs to identify entities, their attributes, and relationships in a relational database.

Key Concepts:

Entities: Core objects or concepts (e.g., User, Article, Comment).

Attributes: Properties of entities (e.g., name, email, title).

Relationships: Connections between entities (1–1, 1–N, N–N).

Cardinalities: Define how many instances of one entity relate to another (0, 1, many).

Conceptual Modeling: First step in designing a relational database.

Theory:

Entities represent important objects.

Attributes describe them.

Relationships link entities (e.g., User writes Article, Article receives Comment).

Cardinalities specify the number of links possible.

Practical Example (Blog Database):

Entities:

User (id, name, email, role)

Article (id, title, content, date_pub)

Comment (id, content, author, date)

Relationships:

User → Article: one user writes many articles (1–N).

Article → Comment: one article receives many comments (1–N)
